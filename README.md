# Lucas's dotfiles

This is a collection of my tmux,vim, and bash configurations.

This setup works for me but it may not work for you. So feel free to steal any ideas that you find
interesting, and if you like contribute back tips, tricks, and other tidbits via Pull Requests.

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lucas-giaco/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
bash install.sh
```
